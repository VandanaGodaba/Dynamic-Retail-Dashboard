# Dynamic Retail Dashboard in Excel

## Overview

The **Dynamic Retail Dashboard** is an Excel-based business intelligence tool designed to help retail professionals analyze their business performance effectively. This dashboard integrates data from multiple sources and provides actionable insights through interactive visualizations and dynamic reporting.

The project uses three primary tables (Orders, People, and Returns) that are connected to the Excel file hosted on GitHub. The data is processed using **Power Query** to perform essential transformations, and the dashboard leverages **PivotTables**, **dynamic charts**, and **key performance indicators (KPIs)** to allow for real-time analysis.

This dashboard helps retail businesses track important metrics, analyze sales performance, and identify trends, providing insights that can drive business decisions.

## Key Metrics (KPIs)

The dashboard tracks several key performance indicators (KPIs), which provide a quick overview of the business performance. These KPIs are dynamically updated based on the selected filters and data inputs.

| KPI Name        | Symbol | Description                                                   |
|-----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total Sales**     | ðŸ’°     | Sum of all sales revenue from all orders.                     |
| **Total Profit**    | ðŸ“ˆ     | Sum of profits generated from all orders.                     |
| **Total Quantity**  | ðŸ“¦     | Total number of items sold across all orders.                 |
| **Total Orders**    | ðŸ›’     | Total number of orders placed by customers.                   |
| **Profit Margin**   | ðŸ’¹     | Average profit margin for all orders (Profit/Sales).          |

These KPIs are displayed dynamically on the dashboard and are automatically updated when new data is loaded.
