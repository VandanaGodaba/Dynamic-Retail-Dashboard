# Dynamic Retail Dashboard in Excel

## Overview

The **Dynamic Retail Dashboard** is an Excel-based business intelligence tool designed to help retail professionals analyze their business performance effectively. This dashboard integrates data from multiple sources and provides actionable insights through interactive visualizations and dynamic reporting.

The project uses three primary tables (Orders, People, and Returns) that are connected to the Excel file hosted on GitHub. The data is processed using **Power Query** to perform essential transformations, and the dashboard leverages **PivotTables**, **dynamic charts**, and **key performance indicators (KPIs)** to allow for real-time analysis.

This dashboard helps retail businesses track important metrics, analyze sales performance, and identify trends, providing insights that can drive business decisions.
